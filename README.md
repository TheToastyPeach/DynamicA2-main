<p>-A mini-game site to enjoy with friends! </p>
<p>-Enjoy felxing your brain to see who has more movie knowledge!</p>
<p>-Be careful to concider how you're judging movies though!</p>
<p>-I've added the most common critical determinants of a films preceived "quality" to play with!</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>This site makes use of the <em>IMDbOT API</em>, take a look here:</p>
<p>https://github.com/SpEcHiDe/IMDbOT</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>To use the site, choose your options with the sliders, and have you and a friend take turns looking for a movie
that fits the criteria set! TV shows don't work for revenue as they can't have a box office release!</p>
